JSON-based NoSQL data stores include MongoDB and CouchDB 1.1.1.2 restful json web servies RESTful web services use HTTP verbs to tell the server what action the client intends. The actions supported are: Create a new entry in the resource collection: HTTP POST. Retrieve a resource representation: HTTP GET verb. Update (replace) the resource: HTTP PUT. Delete a resource: HTTP DELETE. similar to CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) Use PUT to change the user’s display name by hitting /users/userid with the updated user record. Note that this will completely replace the user record, so make sure that the representation you PUT contains everything you want it to contain. chapter2 functions2.0 intro2.0.1 programming guidelines don’t repeat yourself do one thing(DOT) keep it simple stupid(KISS) This tends to happen when a single line of code is used to accomplish more than a single atomic goal. less is more 2.1 minimize side effects If your function operates on outside variables, return a copy instead of the original. A pure function has no side effects. It does not alter existing variables or program state in any way, and always returns the same value given the same inputs. Wherever possible, make sure that your functions don’t change anything outside the function itself. Return amended copies rather than originals. Note that you can still alter program state. REST works this way: you get a copy of the data resource (called a representation), manipulate it, and send the copy back to the server. Sometimes performance implications make this advice impractical, but it’s helpful to consider the possibility of using pure functions. 2.2 function definition It’s best to avoid conditional function declarations entirely. Function declaration tends to encourage large piles of loosely related functions to grow in your module, with no real hints about what goes where, whether it’s public or private, or how the functions work together 不推荐深层次的匿名function调用,debug起来很麻烦,因为都没有名字,鼓励下面这种 method literal形式,有关系的funciton通过这种形式组织起来,grouped together littering your stack trace with anonnymous functions 1234567var lightBulbAPI = &#123; toggle: function () &#123;&#125;, getState: function () &#123;&#125;, off: function () &#123;&#125;, on: function () &#123;&#125;, blink: function () &#123;&#125; &#125;; 2.2.1 named function expresson Unlike function declarations, the name you assign is only available from within the function From outside the function, you must access the function through the variable it’s assigned to or the parameter it’s passed in on: 1234567 var lightbulbAPI = &#123; toggle: function toggle() &#123;&#125;, getState: function getState() &#123;&#125;, off: function off() &#123;&#125;, on: function on() &#123;&#125;, blink: function blink() &#123;&#125;&#125;; 2.2.2 lambdas Lambdas are frequently confused with anonymous functions, closures, first-class functions, and higher order functions. The concepts are all similar, but they mean different things. It is common to confuse the words “closure” and “lambda” as synonyms. That is not accurate. Not all lambdas are closures, and not all closures are lambdas. A closure is created when a function references data that is contained outside the function scope. A lambda is a function that is used as a value (assigned to a variable or passed between functions). Some languages support lambdas but do not support closures. Higher-order functions are functions that consume or return functions as data. Lambdas get passed to and/or returned from higher order functions, and a function might be both a lambda and a higher order function, but not all higher order functions are lambdas. If a function is used as an argument or return value, it’s a lambda. 2.2.3 Immediately Invoked Function Expressions12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334(function () &#123; var isOn = false, toggle = function toggle() &#123; isOn = !isOn; return isOn; &#125;, getState = function getState() &#123; // Implementation... &#125;, off = function off() &#123; // Implementation... &#125;, on = function on() &#123; // Implementation... &#125;, blink = function blink() &#123; // Implementation... &#125;, lightbulb = &#123; toggle: toggle, getState: getState, off: off, on: on, blink: blink &#125;; test('Prototypes with IIFE.', function () &#123; equal(lightbulb.toggle(), true, 'Lightbulb turns on.'); equal(lightbulb.toggle(), false, 'Lightbulb turns off.'); &#125;);&#125;()); 2.2.4 method context Method invocation applies the function to the object to which it is attached. It takes the form object.methodName() (dot notation) or object[&#39;methodName&#39;]() (square bracket notation) someMethod.call(context, argument1, argument2, ...); someMethod.apply(context, someArray); toggle = lightbulb.toggle.bind(lightbulb); 这样 toggle代码中的this总是指向 lightbulb,如果不这样bind,那么this可能会指向更上层的object 2.3 function scope Variable scope is the section of code in which the identifier refers to the expected value. Outside a variable’s scope, the variable is undefined or replaced by another variable with the same name. The desire to use block scope can be a good code smell that indicates that it may be time to break a function into smaller pieces in order to encourage readability, organization, and code reuse. It’s a good idea to keep functions small. 2.3.1 hoisting JavaScript builds its execution environment in two passes. The declaration pass sets up the runtime environment, where it scans for all variable and function declarations and creates the identifiers. The second pass is the execution pass. After the first pass, all declared functions are available, but variables are still undefined. 123456789101112131415161718var x = 1;(function () &#123; console.log(x); var x = 2;&#125;());等同于var x = 1;(function () &#123; var x; // Declaration is hoisted and x is undefined. console.log(x); x = 2; // Initialization is still down here.&#125;());结果是undefined Functions behave a little differently. Both the identifier number and the function body are hoisted, 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132test('Function declaration hoisting', function () &#123; function number() &#123; return 1; &#125; (function () &#123; equal(number(), 2, 'Inner scope wins.'); function number() &#123; return 2; &#125; &#125;()); equal(number(), 1, 'Outer scope still works.');&#125;);等价于test('Function declaration hoisted.', function () &#123; function number() &#123; return 1; &#125; (function () &#123; function number() &#123; return 2; &#125; equal(number(), 2, 'Inner scope wins.'); &#125;()); equal(number(), 1, 'Outer scope still works.');&#125;); Function expressions do not share this behavior, because they do not declare a function. Instead, they declare a variable and are subject to the same variable-hoisting behavior: If you declare all of your variables at the top of your function, and define your functions before you try to use them, you’ll never need to worry about any of this. This practice can substantially reduce scope-related bugs. 2.3.2 closuresIn a nutshell, a closure stores function state, even after the function has returned. To create a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function. The inner function will have access to the variables declared in the outer function. This technique is commonly used to give objects data privacy. 2.4 Method Design some principle Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) Do One Thing (DOT), and do it well Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)2.4.1 named parameters 1234567var newUser = createUser(&#123; name: 'Mike', showInSearch: false&#125;);//or 这种方法不更改其他object,创建了新的object,是的代码可重用return $.extend(&#123;&#125;, userProto, options); 2.4.2 Function Polymorphism基于conditon logic branch 实现多态 This manual style of dynamic dispatch is a common technique in jQuery plug-ins in order to enable developers to add many methods to a plug-in without adding them all to the jQuery prototype (jQuery.fn). Using this technique, you can claim a single name on the jQuery prototype and add as many methods as you like to it. Users then select the method they want to invoke using:$(selection).yourPlugin(&#39;methodName&#39;, params); 2.4.3 Generics and Collection Polymorphism2.4.4 function chaining and fluent APISChaining has its disadvantages. It can encourage you to do too much in a single line of code, it can encourage you to write too much procedural code, and it can be difficult to debug. It’s tough to set a breakpoint in the middle of a chain. 2.5 Functional programming2.5.1 stateless functions (pure functions)Pure functions are stateless. This means that they do not use or modify variables, objects, or arrays that were defined outside the function. Given the same inputs, stateless functions will always return the same output. Stateless functions won’t break if you call them at different times. To maximize code reuse, try to make as many functions as possible both stateless and generic (or polymorphic). Many jQuery methods satisfy both requirements. Such functions tend to be very useful library methods. 2.5.2 partial application and curryingYou may have heard this process described as currying. The two are commonly confused, but there is a difference. Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions, each of which takes no more than one argument. 2.6 Asynchronous Operations2.6.2 Promises and DeferredsThe difference between a promise and a callback is that a promise is an object that gets returned from the callee, instead of a function that gets passed into and invoked by the callee. With promises, it’s much easier to add additional callbacks if you need them and to isolate those callbacks from each other so that the callback code can be organized independently of the initiating call. chapter 3 objectsPrimitive types behave like objects when you use the property access notations, but you can’t assign new properties to them. Primitives get wrapped with an object temporarily, and then that object is immediately thrown away. Any attempt to assign values to properties will seem to succeed, but subsequent attempts to access that new property will fail. it’s possible to create an object on demand at the precise moment it’s needed (lazy instantiation), the singleton is reduced to an object literal. JavaScript is not a classical OO language. It’s a prototypal language. 3.1 classical inheritance is obsoleteThose who are unaware they are walking in darkness will never seek the light. two foundational principles of object-oriented design: Program to an interface, not an implementation. Favor object composition over class inheritance. Classical inheritance breaks the principle of encapsulation and tightly couples the child class to its ancestors. inheritance causes several problems: tight coupling Multiple inheritance is complicated Brittle architecture The gorilla/banana problem","categories":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}],"tags":[{"name":"前端","slug":"前端","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/tags/前端/"},{"name":"读书","slug":"读书","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/tags/读书/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}]},{"title":"读书-static-site-generators","slug":"读书-static-site-generators","date":"2018-01-22T12:57:01.000Z","updated":"2018-06-10T09:56:22.414Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/01/22/读书-static-site-generators/","link":"","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/2018/01/22/读书-static-site-generators/","excerpt":"","text":"chapter 1 What are Static sites? 1.1 CMS 1.1.1 国内有没有大机构用 Drupal 来构建官网？ https://www.zhihu.com/question/19648357 1.2 dynamic aspects 1.2.1 对静态站点添加动态内容的一些服务 1.2.2 BAAS: backend as a service例子 https://www.zhihu.com/question/22098754 这里给出一些BaaS服务提供商 chapter 1 What are Static sites?1.1 CMS CMS: To this day, most of the content published on the Web runs through some form of content Management system.

This is a common source of confusion, pay close attention to the units. For example, to put a 10 megabyte (MB) file “on the wire” over a 1Mbps link, we will need 80 seconds. 10MB is equal to 80Mb because there are 8 bits for every byte! The Many Components of Latency https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_device_bit_rates Speed of Light and Propagation Latency CDN: Content delivery network (CDN) services provide many benefits, but chief among them is the simple observation that distributing the content around the globe, and serving that content from a nearby location to the client, enables us to significantly reduce the propagation time of all the data packets. We may not be able to make the packets travel faster, but we can reduce the distance by strategically positioning our servers closer to the users! Leveraging a CDN to serve your data can offer significant performance benefits. Last- Mile Latency Bandwidth in Core Networks Bandwidth at the Network Edge Delivering Higher Bandwidth and Lower Latencies Building Blocks of TCP introduction The HTTP standard does not mandate TCP as the only transport protocol. If we wanted, we could deliver HTTP via a datagram socket (User Datagram Protocol or UDP), or any other transport protocol of our choice, but in practice all HTTP traffic on the Internet today is delivered via TCP due to the many great and convenient features it provides out of the box. Three- Way Handshake Congestion Avoidance and Control Bandwidth- Delay Product Head- of- Line Blocking Optimizing for TCP Performance Checklist Optimizing TCP performance pays high dividends, regardless of the type of application, for every new connection to your servers. A short list to put on the agenda: Upgrade server kernel to latest version. Ensure that cwnd size is set to 10. Ensure that window scaling is enabled. Disable slow-start after idle. Investigate enabling TCP Fast Open. Eliminate redundant data transfers. Compress transferred data. Position servers closer to the user to reduce roundtrip times. Reuse TCP connections whenever possible. Investigate “TCP Tuning for HTTP” recommendations.

With Ajax, Web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.[2] In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.[3] Asynchronous HTML and HTTP (AHAH) involves using XMLHTTPRequest to retrieve (X)HTML fragments, which are then inserted directly into the Web page. 缺点 ajax在低级设备上不被支持,这样代码必须在简单的form表单可以运行 same-origin policy 不支持跨域调用,但是也可以通过iframe或者JSONP技术来绕开这个限制. The asynchronous callback-style of programming ,难以调试 异步这个性质会导致client must poll the server, instead of listening, which incurs significant overhead. 低效, websockets可以作为一种替代方案 相关名词 JSONP https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP JSONP (JSON with Padding or JSON-P[1]) is used to request data from a server residing in a different domain than the client. It was proposed by Bob Ippolito in 2005.[2] JSONP enables sharing of data bypassing same-origin policy. The policy disallows running JavaScript to read media DOM elements or XHR data fetched from outside the page&apos;s origin. The aggregation of the site&apos;s scheme, port number and host name identifies as its origin. Due to inherent insecurities, JSONP is being replaced by CORS. callback In computer programming, a callback is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an asynchronous callback. In all cases, the intention is to specify a function or subroutine as an entity[clarification needed] that is, depending on the language, more or less similar to a variable (see first-class functions). First-class function poll 轮询 Polling is the process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness or state, often with low-level hardware. For example, when a printer is connected via a parallel port, the computer waits until the printer has received the next character. These processes can be as minute as only reading one bit. Τhis is sometimes used synonymously with busy-wait polling. In this situation, when an I/O operation is required, the computer does nothing other than check the status of the I/O device until it is ready, at which point the device is accessed. In other words, the computer waits until the device is ready. Polling also refers to the situation where a device is repeatedly checked for readiness, and if it is not, the computer returns to a different task. Although not as wasteful of CPU cycles as busy waiting, this is generally not as efficient as the alternative to polling, interrupt-driven I/O. Polling, or polled operation, in computer science, refers to actively sampling the status of an external device by a client program as a synchronous activity. Polling is most often used in terms of input/output (I/O), and is also referred to as polled I/O or software-driven I/O. Parallel port https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port#Centronics 主要由打印机技术发展而开发出的技术,host和打印机并行通信,后来hosts发展出了缓冲技术,提高了打印机的效率,降低了通信成本 A parallel port is a type of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. The name refers to the way the data is sent; parallel ports send multiple bits of data at once, in parallel communication, as opposed to serial interfaces that send bits one at a time. To do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and port connectors, and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports which only require one data line. WebSocket WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C. WebSocket is a different TCP protocol from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and, as such, depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket &quot;is designed to work over HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries&quot; thus making it compatible with the HTTP protocol. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header[1] to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a browser and a web server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the browser without being solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between a browser and the server. The communications are done over TCP port number 80 (or 443 in the case of TLS-encrypted connections), which is of benefit for those environments which block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet. The WebSocket protocol is currently supported in most major browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera. WebSocket also requires web applications on the server to support it.","categories":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}],"tags":[{"name":"前端","slug":"前端","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/tags/前端/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}]},{"title":"全栈之路","slug":"全栈之路","date":"2018-01-10T13:07:22.000Z","updated":"2018-06-10T09:54:13.702Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/01/10/全栈之路/","link":"","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/2018/01/10/全栈之路/","excerpt":"","text":"Front-End Developer Handbook 2017 https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2017/ 一个全栈增长工程师的练手项目集http://www.epubit.com.cn/book/details/4868 有了这个列表，程序员不愁没练手的小项目了http://blog.jobbole.com/49762/http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/ 有哪些适合新手练手的前端项目？https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22766255 大量的实例http://www.fgm.cc/learn/ 大量前端demohttps://github.com/YUUXIAO/webProject 若干demohttps://github.com/hwaphon/WebProject 天猫官网demohttp://how2j.cn/k/tmall-front/tmall-front-790/790.html?tid=31 微信demohttps://github.com/useryangtao/vue-wechat 天猫整站的开发http://how2j.cn/stage/39.html","categories":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}],"tags":[{"name":"全栈","slug":"全栈","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/tags/全栈/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"技术","slug":"技术","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/categories/技术/"}]},{"title":"读书 Front-End Developer Handbook 2017","slug":"读书-Front-End-Developer-Handbook-2017","date":"2018-01-09T17:18:06.000Z","updated":"2018-06-10T09:54:34.422Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/01/10/读书-Front-End-Developer-Handbook-2017/","link":"","permalink":"https://chesterwang.github.io/blog/2018/01/10/读书-Front-End-Developer-Handbook-2017/","excerpt":"","text":"part1 introduction 前端runtime web browser headless browser http://blog.csdn.net/u014745198/article/details/60757926 A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. 那么浏览器该有的东西它都应该有，只是看不到界面而已。 list of headless browsers: chrome/firefox/PhantomJS/HtmlUnit/TrifleJS/Splash/slimerjs Headless browsers are a web browser without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface programmatically for the purpose of web page automation (e.g., functional testing, scraping, unit testing, etc.).
